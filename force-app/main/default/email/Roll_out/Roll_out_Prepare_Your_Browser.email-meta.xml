    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

In anticipation of the launch of Salesforce.com, please take a few moments to prepare and optimize your web browser.  A job aid has been developed to help you with this request.  
 
The preparation of your browser should take approximately 15 minutes of active engagement.  If your computer does not have the latest required software updates, this job aid will instruct you install those, before upgrading and/or configuring your browser - these may take time to run, so consider installing required updates  as the final task in your work day or work week.
 
You can download the job aid by clicking on the link below, or pasting it into your browser window:

I look forward to speaking to you at our Kick-off call on Tuesday!
 
Kind Regards,
