Greetings {!Receiving_User.FirstName}, 

As part of our annual Salesforce Report clean up we have identified reports you have created that haven’t been ran in more than 2 years.  These reports are now in the “Last Chance” folder.  If these reports are of value to you please access them and save them to your personal reports folder.  In 30 days the reports in this folder will be deleted.

Thank You.
