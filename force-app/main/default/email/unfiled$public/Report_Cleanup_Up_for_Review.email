{!Receiving_User.FirstName},

As part of our annual Salesforce Report cleanup we have identified reports you have created that haven’t been ran in over a year.  These reports are now in the “Up for Review” folder.  If these reports are of value to you please access them and save them to your Personal Reports folder.  In 60 days the reports in this folder will be deleted.

Thank You.
