Hello {!Contact.FirstName}, 

I noticed you have not signed into Salesforce.com since Feb. 3rd.  I just wanted to touch base with you to see if you were having any technical difficulties signing into the system.  If not, please make sure you are working in Salesforce every week to keep your information updated.  Salesforce can be a valuable tool to help you keep all your customer interactions in once place and provide visibility into your deals and where they are in the sales process to help drive them to a close.  When used everyday it can be an invaluable tool to help you stay focused and grow your sales.  
 
If you would like to set up some time to review some best practices on how to effectively utilize Salesforce, please let me know and I will be happy to a schedule a one-on-one training session.  Otherwise, please make sure you sign into Salesforce today to review and update your records.  Thank you for being part of the Sears Commercial team and helping to support the Salesforce.com platform.
